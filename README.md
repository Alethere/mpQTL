Multiparental Polyploid Populations 

This repository contains code and data simulation from the thesis work "Multiparental Polyploid Populations: A computational study in R" [http://edepot.wur.nl/446743], which was done under the Plant Breeding department of Wageningen University and Research (WUR), in Wageningen, the Netherlands. It contains:

  1. Genotype simulation code to be run from R using the `PedigreeSim v2.0` program by _Voorrips and Maliepaard, 2012_ [https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-13-248].
  2. Phenotype simulation code as described in the thesis.
  3. The mixed model QTL solver based on rrBLUP estimation, using the biallelic, ancestral and parental models.
